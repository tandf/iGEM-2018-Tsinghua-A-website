The fifth Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) we attended in August was accredited by the iGEM authority. In the conference, we presented our team¡¯s poster and demonstrated the project. With abundant preparations and excelsior attitudes, we achieved great success and high reputation.
Every night during the conference, our poster attracted a number of students from other universities to discuss with us. After a short period of dissemination, our project¡¯s designs and effects were learned by almost all participants. While giving publicity to ourselves, we paid attention to other teams¡¯ lecture and presentation, taking notes and discussing together late in the hotel.
On the last day, our representation was splendid due to lucid logical structure and full plans to answer the questions raised by famous iGEMer, the special guest of the conference Zhang Haoqian, and get recognition from all guests present.
