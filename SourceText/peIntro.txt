An exhibition displaying synthetic biology to public with specially designed activities for young students is held in China Science and Technology Museum during National Day holiday, attracting more than 300 people to our booth each day. Themed as ‘How microorganism turning to biosensor’, the project gave young visitors a brief idea of synthetic biology by watching videos, going through posters, experiencing microscope, DIY DNA models as well as painting with fluorescent bacteria. The exhibition is also closely related to our allergy test program via elaborating posters describing mechanisms of allergy, how yeast is modulated to function diagnostically and methods of prevention. Positive feedback is received from both the visitors and the museum. Apart from the joy shining in children’s eyes, we could also see their interest in synthetic biology grow and we hope to see future iGEMers rise from these kids, inspired by us.
