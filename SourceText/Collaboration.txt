This year, our program held tight to the ethos of collaboration. In the very beginning stage of brainstorming, we exchanged ideas with Team BITChina2017 about building biosensor in modified pheromone pathway in yeast, and obtained yeast modified by the team. While Team BIT-China2018 worked on their program this year, we reciprocally offered them help in modeling and data processing. Additionally, we cooperated with team Tsinghua in both stages of experiment and human practice, and hosted exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum in joint hands. We sincerely express our gratitude towards Team BIT-China and Team Tsinghua for their help and its profound assistance to our work.
