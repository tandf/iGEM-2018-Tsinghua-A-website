//OD Function Testing2
//Test method3
    We made two groups of a series of cells samples with different concentration by gradient dilution. And we used OD function of our device and spectrophotometer to test the sample respectively. By this way, we can get a relation between the readout of our kit and the real OD value. If the relation is linear, we can use a linear model to analyze and predict.

$$
spectrophotometer=-0.06759+4.61774 DeviceReadout_i+\epsilon_i /; \epsilon_i~N(0,0.0052)
$$
Taking the OD values measured by spectrophotometer as real values, it is obvious that the real OD values can be derived from the readout of our device, which means that our device is able to measure the OD value of samples accurately.

//Florescence Function Testing2
//Test method3
As we already derived the model of OD function of our kit, we design a method to test our florescence function based on it. We made a group of cells samples that steadily express the fluorescence protein by gradient dilution, and use our hardware to measure the OD values and Fluorescence intensity of each sample. As the criteria of the method, the OD values should be proportion to the fluorescence intensity of samples. So we use this method to test if the florescence function of our kit can actually work on florescence intensity testing.

$$
FL_i=53.828+88.287OD_i+\epsilon_i /; \epsilon_i~N(0,6.16)
$$
The linear regression model is shown above, which implies us that the florescence function can regularly work. And it can test the florescence based on the linear model we made.
